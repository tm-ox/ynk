Established in 2010 as a monthly experimental whatever event at Jogja National Museum in Yogyakarta, Indonesia by Wok the Rock ([Yes No Wave](https://yesnowave.com), [Mes 56](http://mes56.com/)) & Timothy O'Donoghue ([Oxen Free](https://oxenfree.net), [Bus](https://www.busprojects.org.au/)), Yes No Klub (YNK) now consists of a core group of contributors responsible for operations as required.

YNK is an official host organisation for [AsiaLink](https://asialink.unimelb.edu.au/) (Australia) in Indonesia and co-managed a project with the German cultural centre [Goethe-Institute](https://www.goethe.de/ins/id/en/index.html/), Germany's [CTM Festival](https://www.ctm-festival.de/) for Adventurous Music and Art, Singapore's [Playfreely / Blackkaji](https://www.facebook.com/playfreelyexperiment) and Manila's [WSK Festival](https://www.wsk.io/) entitled [Nusasonic](http://www.nusasonic.com/).

Through the Nusasonic project YNK organised a five day, multiple venue festival in Yogyakarta with participants from throughout Southeast Asia and Europe in 2018, a two month Nusasonic residency for [Nadah El Shazly](https://nadahelshazly.bandcamp.com/) (Cairo) and [Jessica Ekomane](https://www.jessicaekomane.com/) (Berlin) in 2019 and participated in Nusasonic events throughout Southeast Asia and Europe.

In 2020 YNK furthered its international network through a collaboration with HuruHara for the inclusion of four Indonesian artists in the [AsiaTopa Festival](https://www.asiatopa.com.au/) in Melbourne, Australia.

During Covid YNK shifted its focus to the curation of content for external events, most notably [ArtJog](https://www.artjog.id/), the facilitation of a stage at [Pestapora](https://pestapora.com) with artists from throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines and virtual participation in [MUTEK Montr√©al](https://montreal.mutek.org/).

2023 sees YNK return to regular programming with monthly electronic event Yes No Disko, continued curation for both ArtJog and Pestapora and a number of Yes No Klub gigs.
